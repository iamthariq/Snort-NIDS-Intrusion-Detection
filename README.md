# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort

## Project Overview
This repository contains a two-month Cyber Security Internship project focused on implementing a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort.

The project involves monitoring live network traffic, detecting malicious activities, and generating real-time alerts using both default and custom Snort rules.

## Lab Environment
- Victim Machine: Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 (Snort Installed)
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
- Virtualization: VMware / VirtualBox (Bridged Mode)

## Tools & Technologies
- Snort IDS
- Nmap
- Nping
- Hydra
- SQLMap
- Linux (Ubuntu & Kali)

## Attacks Simulated
- ICMP Flood & Ping Scan
- TCP SYN, FIN, and Xmas Scans
- SSH Login & Brute Force Attacks
- FTP & Telnet Access Attempts
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Directory Traversal
- Sensitive File Exposure (.git)
- Malicious File Upload
- Automated SQLMap Scanning

## Custom Snort Rules
Custom Snort rules were developed and tuned to improve detection accuracy and reduce alert noise.
